# Row pattern matching for R

This is basically just a crude attempt to use regex to capture patterns of rows, by representing rows as a string of characters where each character represents a row. This is attempting to reproduce the core functionality of the SQL:2016 row pattern matching, but much more primitive and utilizing existing R and tidyverse functions as much as possible.
